The first public Beta version will be available very soon. What\u2019s this? Ramses , the Rx Asset Management System, is a complete framework to help you, your team, your studio, track the production of your films. It is meant to be used both by freelancers, small or big teams. Let\u2019s have a look at a few key features. \u25b9 Free and open source Ramses is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3, which means you\u2019re free to do anything you\u2019d like with it, use it the way you want, modify it, and share your modifications. \u25b9 Modular and scalable Ramses is made of several components which can be used either individually or as a whole framework . If you just need an add-on to your creative software improve your workflow and versionning, you could use only on of the Ramses Add-ons . If you\u2019re interested in production tracking, you\u2019ll need the Ramses Client Application and maybe connect it to the Ramses Server to stay connected with your team. Of course, each of these components can work together and share information for a seamless integration into your workflow . \u25b8 Read more \u25b9 Planning Ramses helps you easily plan your production , and estimate how long you\u2019ll need to produce your project. For each shot and asset of the project, you\u2019ll be able to (automatically) estimate how long it will take to produce, and Ramses will keep track of all estimations for you so you can plan accordingly. \u25b8 Read more \u25b9 Production Tracking At any time, Ramses can tell you where you are in the production, how late (or not) you are, and warn you if something\u2019s going wrong. You can always keep a close (or overall) look at the production , and check which assets and shots are longer or shorter to produce, and the state in which they are at any time. \u25b8 Read more \u25b9 Pipeline automation In combination with the Ramses Add-ons which integrate Ramses in your favorite creative software, Ramses is able to automate your pipeline , managing the versionning of the files, the exports, imports and all these manual tasks a robot could do for you. An example: the Autodesk Maya shelf of the Ramses Add-on. With a nice and modern nodal view, it\u2019s easy to design your pipeline, connecting each step and setting how the data should go from one step to the other. All this information will be used both by the Ramses production tracking algorithms and the Add-ons to help you focus on your real work: creation . \u25b8 Read more \u25b9 (Very) Easy-to-use A tool like Ramses is here to help, not to give you a headache. All user interface components have been carefully crafted to be beautiful, but most of all to be intuitive and practical . Everything has to be clear, precise, and meaningful. Of course, there\u2019s this comprehensive documentation if you have any doubt.. \u25b9 And also\u2026 Why would one want to track one\u2019s production from a web browser? Ramses comes with its own native application for Linux , Mac OS and Windows . It\u2019s designed to by very light and unintrusive, fast and responsive. It ususally takes about ten times less memory than a usual web-browser with a single tab opened. Ramses is extensible . Although it already comes with some add-ons for your creative software, if you have specific needs, you can use the provided Python and Adobe ExtendScript API , to implement your own add-ons which fully integrate with both Ramses and your creative applications. The Daemon and the Server API are also fully documented. And, after all, Ramses is open source! Ramses can manage all your files : the idea is that you won\u2019t ever need to search for any file through the system\u2019s explorer. \u25b9 The future Ramses is (far from) not finished . And probably never will: it is going to evolve, and there are a lot of other planned features and improvements on their way! Here are some of the features which are not available yet but which will be available in the future. Full SSL encryption when connecting to the server. SSL may already be available on Linux and will be available on Windows and Mac OS shortly. If Ramses \u2018 beta versions can already be tested without it, it is a mandatory feature for the release versions, as the security of your data is non-negociable. The Dashboard will be an area where each user accesses all its important data and schedule. It comes with notifications so you won\u2019t miss any change concerning your assets, shots and steps. The Offline mode for the Ramses Client Application will make it easier to use for one-man bands; you will be able to use Ramses without having to install the server. This also means you\u2019ll still be able to use Ramses even if you\u2019re not connected to the network, when you\u2019re in a train or on top of a mountain. Project Planning : a simple but indispensable tool to easily plan the production of the project, at the very beginning of the production. With this planning tool you will be able to set the important dates of the production, the deadlines for each step, all in an easy-to-use and visual panel. Status automation : when a character is rigged, it means it\u2019s ready to be animated. Status automation will automatically update the states of all the items according to the pipeline design, and your custom rules. Data export and import : if you\u2019re planning important software update, or for your backups at the end of a production, it may be useful to export and re-import your data. File tools will provide automatic ways to manage your files, create new assets and shots from already existing files, clean the tree, backup, remove temporary data, batch rename files and folders\u2026 Editing tools to manage your shots from your edits. Automatically set shot duration, order and other metadata by just importing your edit. A lot of UI improvements and tweaks are planned too, and work will be done to improve the performance of the Ramses Client Application even further. Syncthing integration will provide a free, open, and secure way to synchronize all files and data of your production accross multiple workstations, servers, NAS, etc. There\u2019s also a lot of ongoing work to extend the supported creative applications through Ramses Add-ons. This table shows what\u2019s planned, what\u2019s already available, what will be available soon. Application Scripting Language Status Comment API Python A Beta version is already available.

This makes it very modular and scalable to any kind of production, from the freelancer working at home to the biggest studios. General Description The Ramses framework can be viewed as a hirerachical tree, going from the data stored by the Ramses Server up to the creative applications add-ons and the files and folder structure on the workstations. Ramses Data : all the meta-data is stored by Ramses in an SQL server. Ramses Server : this data is managed by a webserver, which reads and writes the data on demand from connected Ramses Clients . Ramses Client : the client is run on each workstation and is the central application and provides the main User Interface of Ramses . Ramses Daemon : the daemon is run by the client itself, and is a local server which is used as a bridge between creative applications and the client itself. It handles all communications and data with the applications add-ons. Ramses Add-ons : the add-ons are scripts to be used from inside the creative applications (e.g. Blender , Maya , After Effects \u2026) so that the artist does not have to leave his application to use Ramses . Ramses Tree : on the lowest level, Ramses manages the files and folder structure on the workstation (and/or clones on remote locations). The modularity of Ramses comes from the fact that children modules don\u2019t necessarily need the parent module, at least for their core functionnalities. For example, you can use the Ramses Client without the Ramses Server and Data , or you can even use the Ramses add-ons without the Ramses Client . But you can not skip levels, i.e. the Ramses Add-ons can not be used with the Ramses Server without having both the Ramses Client and Ramses Daemon . Ramses Data Most of the data used by Ramses is stored in SQL databases. When using the Ramses Server , the main data is stored in a remote SQL server; in its default implementation, the Ramses Server works with MySQL . The Ramses Client keeps a local copy of the data in a SQLite database. Ramses Server The Ramses Server is the interface between the client and the data. It is meant only to be used programmatically and it does not have any UI. It is a very standard REST web server written in PHP , exchanging data in JSON . This means the Ramses Server and its associated Ramses Data can be easily installed everywhere, on a workstation (with a standard web server), on a shared hosting or a private server, no matter the operating system. Installation of Ramses on a server is as simple as copying php files to the server, and adding a little information in the configuration file. Ramses Client and Daemon The client is the main Ramses application. It can be used without the Ramses Server , without losing any functionnality, apart from collaborative work. In this case, the data is stored locally. When the server is not available (e.g. loss of internet connection), the Ramses Client can still work offline, and synchronize the data as soon as it comes online later. The client is a native application ( Qt / C++ ), and is available on Linux , Windows and MacOS , which makes it fast and lightweight. It may be available later for Android . The client also runs the Ramses Daemon which is a local server which communicates with the Ramses Add-ons and shares the data with them. Ramses Add-ons The add-ons are scripts available inside the creative applications (e.g. Blender , Maya , After Effects \u2026). They could be used without the client, with limited functionnalities. In this case, data is retrieved from the Ramses Tree . The add-ons are in charge of file management and versionning, publishing, etc. Ramses Tree On the lowest level, Ramses handles all files and folders for the managed projects. It is able to retrieve missing data from the file structure, and missing files from clones on remote and backup locations. Both the Add-ons and the Client can manage the files and folders.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"components/#ramses-components","text":"Ramses is a complete framework made of different components interacting together.

They are basic add-ons to demonstrate some capabilities of Ramses for file versionning and asset management, and can be used as templates to develop your own add-ons working with Ramses. They will be developed one after each other, and you\u2019re welcome to contribute with your own! Here are some guidelines and descriptions about how these add-ons should work. We\u2019re trying to apply the same guidelines to all host applications for a unified experience. These add-ons should use the provided Scripting API available at first in Python and Adobe ExtendsScript . Add-ons Introduction Available Commands Open Save Save new version & Publish Retrieve version Publish as template Open template Import template Settings Open Ramses UI / UX Integrated commands UI Panel Settings Introduction Although the add-ons are primarily meant to be used in conjunction with the Ramses Client Application (which in turn may be connected to the Ramses Server ), they can also be used on their own. In which case not all functionnalities will be available; the differences are mentionned in this documentation. Available Commands Some of these commands manage files in the Ramses Tree , see the corresponding documentation . All commands except open Ramses and Settings should first: If the add-on is not set to offline by the user (in the settings): If the path to the Client executable file is invalid: warn the user and stop. If the user is not connected, warn the user and stop Open // TODO Save If the file is not a working file, but a version coming from the ramses_version subfolder (named restore-vXX ), runs Save new version instead of Save . If the file is in the _versions folder or if its resource name contains restore-vXX . Increments the existing WIP file, saves over it, and increments again. Else Saves the current file. Backs up the file in the _versions subfolder. Version is automatically incremented if the auto-increment timeout has expired (defined in the settings). If online Send the new status of the asset/shot for this step (version, date, state, comment, completion ratio) to the Ramses Client . See the naming scheme and folder structure for more information. Save new version & Publish If the file is in the ramses_version folder or if its resource name contains restore-vXX . Copies the current working file into the version folder, appending the state got from the Ramses client if available, or else just \u201cv\u201d, and the incremented version number. Saves the current file as the working file (in the working folder, and removing restore-XX from the resource name) Removes the current file (version file, keeps only the new working file) if it was a restored version Else Saves the current file. Copies the current file to the _versions subfolder, appending the current state and the incremented version number. If the file is published Copies the current file to the _published subfolder. If the client is available : sends the update command to the client, with the date, state and version of the current asset/shot, and publish information. Retrieve version Gets a specific version back from the ramses_versions subfolder. Copies the file to the asset/shot folder, adds restore-vXX to the resource name, where XX is the restored version number. Opens it. It is only when the file will be saved that this new copied file will be removed and the working file will be overwritten to a new version. Publish as template Saves the file in the corresponding step folder (in a \u201ctemplates\u201d subfolder), using a specific naming: PROJECTID_G_stepID_template-resourceName.ext (asks for overwrite if the file exists) Saves the file in a temp folder (to never overwrite a template when Ctrl+S) Open template Lists the available templates Opens the selected one Saves it in a temp folder Import template Lists the available templates Imports the selected one Settings Opens the settings editor of the Add-on. Open Ramses Opens the Ramses Client if available. Try to connect to the Daemon . Warns the user if not available/cannot connect to the Daemon . If the Daemon is available, sets the mode to \u201conline\u201d. If not, sets to \u201coffline\u201d. UI / UX Depending on the host application, the implementation and User Interface / User Experience of the add-ons may vary, but they should follow these guidelines as closely as possible. Integrated commands When possible, the commands should be integrated as seamlessly as possible in the host application, e.g. by adding or even replacing menu items for saving files, saving as., etc. Especially for the save command, the default save shortcut (generally [Ctrl] + [S] ) should be replaced by the save command for Ramses . Other save command shortcuts should be added, preferably the same for all add-ons: Save : [Ctrl] + [S] Save new version : [Ctrl] + [Alt] + [S] Publish : [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [P] These shortcuts have been chosen to avoid conflicts in most host applications but can be changed to something else if they\u2019re still conflicting with something important. UI Panel If possible, each Ramses Add-on should provide a UI panel integrated into the host software, but organized similarly in all add-ons, with specific variations to respect the host software UI guidelines. The panel must display buttons for all available commands. The panel must also provide a way to quickly set the current Project and Step , and show the opened asset or shot information: state, version, date, comment, completion ratio\u2026 This information is retrieved from the client application if available, or from the Ramses Tree if not. The panel and this information must be updated as soon as the opened file changes, or at least when the user interacts with it. Information available in the panel: Current user (online only) Current project Step Current shot or asset Containing asset group or sequence (sequence available only if online) Date of latest version (read only) Current state Current resource name Current version (read only) Completion ratio Is template (read only) If the client application is not available, the Project and Step information is displayed but cannot be changed. Comment is not available. Settings If the host application provides a way to display the settings of its add-ons, the settings should be located there (and the settings command should open this location if possible). If it does not, the Add-on must provide a dialog or a panel to let the user change the settings. These settings are: Location of the Ramses Client executable file ( .exe on Windows , .app on MacOS , .appimage or binary on Linux ) Listening port of the Ramses Daemon Note: the settings are saved in a shared location (user documents folder ?) between all add-ons so that they\u2019re configured only once.

You can also easily use the included Ramses Scripting API as a Python module to develop your own functions. Getting started Technically, the simplest and recommended way to extend the Ramses Maya Add-On is to add your own module(s) inside the Add-on iteself. It is very easy and this way you do not need to register your script or plug-in with Maya , Ramses takes care of that for you. Install the Add-On First, install the Ramses Maya Add-On as described here . These folders should be available: icons : The icons used by the Add-On plug-ins : The actual Python code dumaf : Some useful Python code for Maya ramses : The Ramses Scripting API as a Python module ramses_maya : The Add-On itself shelves : The Ramses Maya shelf Create your module All you need to do to easily extend the Ramses Maya Add-On is to create your own module in the plug-ins folder. Create a subfolder in the plug-ins folder, containing an empty __init__.py file. You can also optionally add your own shelf in the shelves folder. The new tree should look like this: icons plug-ins dumaf ramses ramses_maya your_new_module : contains __init__.py shelves : optionally add shelf_YourModule.mel In the new your_new_module/__init__.py file, you will import or code all the methods you want to expose and make available in Maya, for example to be used in a shelf or any other Python script. You can also register your Ramses callbacks there (read below for more information about Ramses callbacks). Here is an example of such an __init__.py file, assuming you have two other files ( anotherFile.py and aSecondFile.py ) in the same folder, containing the actual code and methods to import: from .anotherFile import aPublicMethod from .aSecondFile import aPublishMethod, anImportMethod # Now, 'aPublicMethod' can be called from everyhwere in Maya # And we can register the publish and import method as callbacks for Ramses. # For this, we need to import the Ramses Module (API) from ramses import Ramses # Now we just have to add the callbacks: ramses = Ramses.instance() # The publish method ramses.publishScripts.append( aPublishMethod ) # The import method ramses.importScripts.append( anImportMethod ) Import the module Finally, you just have to import your new module in the ramses_maya module: add a simple import at the end of the ramses_maya/__init__.py file, which should look like this: from .ram_cmds import cmds_classes from ramses import log, LogLevel import your_new_module Both the new module and the shelf will be automatically registered by the Ramses Maya Add-On when it\u2019s loaded in Maya . Example A complete and working example has been made available: it is the extension made for the school Rubika Animation / Supinfocom , for the production pipeline of the graduation movies of the students. You can get it here , and it comes with a comprehensive documentation . Feel free to try and use it, and study it. As explained just before, all the extension is packaged in its own module called rubika in the plug-ins folder. Callbacks Ramses stores three lists of callbacks you can extend. Ramses.publishScripts contains the functions to be called when a scene is being published. When Ramses publishes a scene, it first copies the scene file to the publish folder, and then calls all the scripts listed there. Each callback you add to this list must take three arguments. Read the Scripting API Reference for more information. Ramses.statusScripts contains the functions to be called when a scene status changes. When Ramses updates a status, it first copies the scene file to the version folder and calls the Daemon (if available) to notify the update, and then calls all the scripts listed there. Each callback you add to this list must take two arguments. Read the Scripting API Reference for more information. Ramses.importScripts contains the functions to be called when the user selects an item (shot or asset) to import. By default, if and only if the list is empty, Ramses imports the selected item in the current scene, in a group named after the item, and in another group named after the asset group if it is an asset. Adding new callbacks to the list will de-activate this default behaviour so you can use your own methods for importing items. Each callback you add to this list must take two arguments. Read the Scripting API Reference for more information. There are two ways to register your methods: by using a Maya command, or by forking the provided Add-On to add your functions. Once the callbacks have been registered, they are automatically called when the user interacts with the add-on and wants to update/import/publish an item. You can also explicitly call them by calling these three methods: Ramses.updateStatus( item, status, stepShortName ) Ramses.importItem( item, filePath, stepShortName ) Ramses.publish( item, filePath, stepShortName ) Read the Scripting API Reference for more information. Adding your custom callbacks To register your callbacks, you just have to append them in the corresponding Ramses lists: # We need to import the Ramses Module (API) from ramses import Ramses # Now we just have to add the callbacks ramses = Ramses.instance() # A publish method ramses.publishScripts.append( aPublishMethod ) # An import method ramses.importScripts.append( anImportMethod ) # A status method ramses.statusScripts.append( aStatusMethod ) Now, all these methods will be automatically called each time a status changes, an item is published, or an item is imported. Detailed Example In this example, three files are added, with the import, status, and publish methods. The file plug-ins/your_new_module/myPublishCallbacks.py creates the callbacks used to publish shots and assets. # myPublishCallbacks.py import ramses as ram # Get the ramses instance ramses = ram.Ramses.instance() def publishAsset(item, filePath, step): \"\"\"Callback used to publish Assets only\"\"\" # The item must be a RamAsset if item.itemType() != ram.ItemType.ASSET: return # Now we can do what we need using the RamAsset object, the filePath and the Step doSomething( item.shortName(), item.group(), filePath, step.shortName()) # etc. def publishShot(item, filePath, step): \"\"\"Callback used to publish Shots only\"\"\" # The item must be a RamAsset if item.itemType() != ram.ItemType.SHOT: return # Now we can do what we need using the RamShot object, the filePath and the Step doSomething( item.shortName(), item.duration(), filePath, step.shortName()) # etc. The file plug-ins/your_new_module/myStatusCallbacks.py creates the callbacks used when a status changes. # myStatusCallbacks.py import ramses as ram # Get the ramses instance ramses = ram.Ramses.instance() def updateAsset(item, status, step): \"\"\"Callback used to update Assets only\"\"\" # The item must be a RamAsset if item.itemType() != ram.ItemType.ASSET: return # Now we can do what we need using the RamAsset object, the RamStatus object and the RamStep object doSomething( item.shortName(), item.group(), status.completionRatio, status.user, step.shortName()) # etc. def updateShot(item, filePath, publishFolderPath): \"\"\"Callback used to update Shots only\"\"\" # The item must be a RamShot if item.itemType() != ram.ItemType.SHOT: return # Now we can do what we need using the RamAsset object, the RamStatus object and the RamStep object doSomething( item.shortName(), item.group(), status.completionRatio, status.user, step.shortName()) # etc. The file plug-ins/your_new_module/myImportCallbacks.py creates the callbacks used to import items. # myImportCallbacks.py import ramses as ram # Get the ramses instance ramses = ram.Ramses.instance() def importAsset(item, filePath, step): \"\"\"Callback used to import Assets only\"\"\" # The item must be a RamAsset if item.itemType() != ram.ItemType.ASSET: return # Now we can do what we need using the RamAsset object, the RamStep object and the file path doSomething( item.shortName(), item.group(), step.shortName(), filePath) # etc. The file plug-ins/your_new_module/otherMethods.py creates a few other methods, for example to be used in a Maya shelf . # otherMethods.py def methodForAShelf(): doSomething() Finally, we just need to import these files in the plug-ins/your_new_module/__init__.py file of our custom module.

Check the Read only box. Copy Ramses.mod in one of your modules paths e.g. C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\Maya\\modules . You may need to create the modules folder if it does not exist yet. Repeat this operation on all workstations where you need the module. Restart Maya . Activate the Ramses plug-in from Maya \u2018s plug-in manager. You may need to restart Maya again so that the Ramses shelf is loaded. Features All features of the Ramses add-on are available through the new shelf. They are also registered as Mel and Python Maya commands. All these features are detailed in the next sections. To handle all file naming and sorting, Ramses includes commands to replace all the default Save , Save As and Open functions. Using (almost) only the Ramses commands ensures your files will always be correctly named and in the right location. It also helps Ramses track the production. Feature Maya Command Description Open the Ramses App ramOpenRamses Launches the Ramses Client Application (if its path is correctly set in the settings). Save ramSave Saves and backups the current scene; this save command is also used for production tracking. Comment ramSave Associates a comment wit the current version file. Incremental Save ramSaveVersion Saves and increments the version of the current scene. Update Status ramSaveVersion Saves and increments the version of the current scene, while updating its current production tracking status. Create Preview ramPreview Creates a preview (thumbnail or playblast) of the current scene. Save as ramSaveAs Saves the scene as a new Asset, Shot or General item. Template ramPublishTemplate Saves the current scene as a new template for the current scene. Open / Import ramOpen Opens or imports an Asset, Shot or Template. Retrieve Version ramRetrieveVersion Retrieves and restores a previous version of the current scene. Settings ramSettings Opens the settings dialog for the Ramses Add-on . Save The Ramses Save command starts by saving the current scene, and then runs a few checks before backuping the file into the _versions subfolder: Naming Scheme : checks if the file is correctly named and located. If not, Ramses will run the Save as command instead to ensure the name is correct. Version : checks if the version has to be incremented. That\u2019s the case if the current scene is a restored previous version, or if the latest increment occured before the timeout set in the settings. Depending of these checks, Ramses will automatically associate a comment with the corresponding version to warn of any changes. The Mel and Python corresponding command is: ramSave . It can take two parameters: -set_comment or -sc : boolean used to set a comment associated to the current version file. -comment or -c : string is the comment to be associated if -sc is True . # Python import maya.cmds as cmds # Save the current file cmds.ramSave() # Save the file with a comment (show the comment dialog) cmds.ramSave(set_comment = True) # Save the file with a custom comment cmds.ramSave(sc = True, comment = \"A new comment!\") Comment The Comment command saves the current scene the same way as the Save command, and adds a comment associated with the current version. This comment is displayed with the corresponding version in all version selection dialogs, both in the add-on itself and in the Ramses Client Application , as shown below. A list of versions with a few comments, as shown in the Ramses Maya Add-on . A list of versions with a few comments, as shown in the Ramses Client Application . Settings Versionning The Auto-Increment option sets how many time can be spent before Ramses automatically increments the version of the file when saving. Use this option to be sure you can get back to an earlier version of your work even if you forget to increment the version. the Save hotkey option replaces the default \u201c Save Scene \u201d [Ctrl + S] hotkey from Maya by the Save command from Ramses .

That means you can install it on almost any desktop or server computers, private server, shared hosting, workstation, Raspberry\u2026 It does not need much resources. Prerequisites Ramses Server must be installed on a computer with: An http web server like Apache PHP 7 An acces to a mySQL server and a dedicated database. The recommended configuration is a standard AMP stack ( Apache - mySQL - PHP ), with at least 2GB of RAM if the SQL server is on the same computer than the Apache server.

Note As Ramses is still in development, the only compatible SQL database is mySQL . We may add support for other databases in the future, include SQLite so the Ramses Server could be use without an actual SQL database. We provide a detailed, step-by-step guide to help you install your own web server satisfying these requirements on Windows , Linux or Mac OS if you need to, before installing the Ramses Server : install your own webserver . Standard Installation Create a new base on the SQL server, along with its user and password. Un-Zip the Ramses Server you\u2019ve downloaded. Edit config.php with needed info. Copy the Ramses Server files to the web server (you can just copy the ramses folder from the ZIP archive). Go to http://your.server/ramses/install (if you\u2019re running your own local server, this is probably something like http://localhost/ramses/install ) Delete the install folder from the server. The default user for Ramses is Admin with the password password . You should start by changing this name and password using the Ramses Client Application . config.php The config.php file you have to edit looks like that: // ==== SQL SETTINGS ==== // Host URL $sqlHost = \"localhost\"; $sqlPort = 3306; // Database name $sqlDBName = \"ramses\"; // User $sqlUser = \"ramses\"; // Password $sqlpassword = \"ramsesdbpassword\"; // Table prefix // DO NOT CHANGE THIS, not working yet $tablePrefix = \"ram\"; // ==== SESSION SETTINGS ==== // Session timeout (seconds) // The client will be disconnected after being idle for this time // 30 minutes by default (1800) are more than enough: // The official client makes a call at least every 2 minutes by default. $sessionTimeout = 1800; // Max Session timeout (seconds) // The client will be disconnected no matter what after this time // 5 hours by default( 18000 ) $cookieTimeout = 18000; Hint You will need your database information to configure the Ramses Server to use it. If you don\u2019t know how to do that or if you\u2019ve just installed your own web server following our instructions , read the next section first. $sqlHost is the url or IP of your MySQL server. If you\u2019ve installed your own server locally, you can leave it to \"localhost\" . Don\u2019t forget the quotes! $sqlPort is the port used by the MySQL server. 3306 is the default for most installations, if you need something different, your hosting provider should tell you. $sqlDBName is the name of the specific database you have to create for Ramses . Read below to learn how to create it with phpMyAdmin ; the procedure can be different according to your hosting provider. $sqlUser is the name of the specific MySQL user you have to create for Ramses . Read below to learn how to create it with phpMyAdmin ; the procedure can be different according to your hosting provider. $sqlpassword is the password of the specific MySQL user you have to create for Ramses . Read below to learn how to create it with phpMyAdmin ; the procedure can be different according to your hosting provider. $tablePrefix is a prefix which will be used for the name of the database tables used by Ramses . As soon as this will be implemented, it will allow you to share a database with other instances of Ramses and even any other application (for example if your provider doesn\u2019t allow you to create more databases on your server). Tip If you know what you\u2019re doing, you can actually already change the table prefix, but Ramses will be installed using the default prefix anyway. That means you have to install Ramses with this default ram prefix, then rename all the tables with a new prefix, and finally change the prefix in config.php . Preparing the database Whether you\u2019ve installed your own web server (maybe by following our procedure in order to test the Beta Version of Ramses without using an online server) or you\u2019ve order a shared or private hosting, you will need to create a database to be used by Ramses on the MySQL server. Most of the time, you can do this with phpMyAdmin , although the procedure can be different depending on your web hosting provider. Here are some explanations about how to do that with phpMyAdmin . First, go to the phpMyAdmin web interface. If you\u2019ve installed your own web server locally, this is probably http://localhost/phpmyadmin . Create a new database: on the left panel, click on New . Choose a name, for example ramses and click on Create . This is the name of the database which will be used later in the Ramses Server configuration. The new database should be automatically selected; if not, click on its name on the left panel. Now let\u2019s create a new user for Ramses : click on the Privileges tab. Click on Add user account under the New section. Set the basic login information. The user name can just be ramses ; the user name and password will be used in the Ramses Server configuration later. If your using your own local server, it is better to set the Host name to be Local / localhost . Leave all other options to their defaults, and click on Go at the bottom of the page.

Hint Some of the elements described in this documentation have to be interpreted depending on the language used in the implementations of the Ramses API and may vary a bit. Enumerated Values Enumerated values (a.k.a. Constants ) are predefined sets of values to be used in specific methods. Their name is in CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE, and they\u2019re grouped together by type (for exemple color.RED , or shape.RECTANGLE ). The value itself can be of any type (array, string, number\u2026). # Python # Enumerated values are public static attributes of a containing class. They're declared like this: class Group(): VALUE_1 = 0 VALUE_2 = 1 VALUE_3 = 2 # Example: class Color(): RED = [255,0,0] GREEN = [0,255,0] BLUE = [0,0,255] // ExtendScript // Enumerated values are attributes in simple objects. They're declared like this: var Group = { VALUE_1: 0, VALUE_2: 1, VALUE_3: 2 }; // Example: var Color = { RED: [255,0,0], GREEN: [0,255,0], BLUE: [0,0,255] }; Accessing the data In All \u201c RamClasses \u201d, most of the data is retrieved with methods (instead of accessing it directly from an attribute). This allows the API to get the data from three different locations: already stored in a private attribute of the class instance (set by a previous call to the method or by the constructor). from the Daemon , if and only if Ramses.instance().online is true . from reading the Ramses Tree , the file structure, by retrieving available information from the file names (or eventually file meta-data). The priority for each method of retrieval changes according to the type of data, which can be either mutable or immutable . Mutable data are data which may change regularly and which can\u2019t be stored (like the current status). In this case, they\u2019re retrieved by following these priorities: Got from the Daemon if available: set the private attribute before returning the data. Got from the Ramses Tree : set the private attribute before returning the data. If nothing was found, return the stored data from the corresponding private attribute. Immutable data are data which should not change during a single session (like paths). In this case, Ramses can store and return them without having to check again each time the method is called. If the private attribute contains the data, it is returned. Got from the Daemon if available: set the private attribute before returning the data. Got from the Ramses Tree if available: set the private attribute before returning the data. Here are example concepts in Python and ExtendScript, like what\u2019s done in the provided implementations of the Ramses Add-ons API. # Python class RamClass( object ): # The data can be passed to the constructor. # It may or may not have default values. def __init__(self, someImmutableData='', someMutableData=''): self.__someImmutableData = someImmutableData self.__someMutableData = someMutableData def someMutableData( self ): if Ramses.instance().online(): # If the Daemon is available, try to get the data there theData = Ramses.instance().getData() # Only if we've got the data, store and return it if theData is not None: self.__someMutableData = theData return self.__someMutableData # Try to get from the Ramses Tree theData = AnotherClass.getDataFromPath( somePath ) # If we've got the data, store it if theData is not None: self.__someMutableData = theData # Last resort return return self.__someMutableData def someImmutableData( self ): # We start by checking if we already have some data if self.__someImmutableData != '': # Stop here.

This allows the API to get the data from three different locations: already stored in a private attribute of the class instance (set by a previous call to the method or by the constructor). from the Daemon , if and only if Ramses.instance().online is true . from reading the Ramses Tree , the file structure, by retrieving available information from the file names (or eventually file meta-data). The priority for each method of retrieval changes according to the type of data, which can be either mutable or immutable . Mutable data are data which may change regularly and which can\u2019t be stored (like the current status). In this case, they\u2019re retrieved by following these priorities: Got from the Daemon if available: set the private attribute before returning the data. Got from the Ramses Tree : set the private attribute before returning the data. If nothing was found, return the stored data from the corresponding private attribute. Immutable data are data which should not change during a single session (like paths). In this case, Ramses can store and return them without having to check again each time the method is called. If the private attribute contains the data, it is returned. Got from the Daemon if available: set the private attribute before returning the data. Got from the Ramses Tree if available: set the private attribute before returning the data. Here are example concepts in Python and ExtendScript, like what\u2019s done in the provided implementations of the Ramses Add-ons API. # Python class RamClass( object ): # The data can be passed to the constructor. # It may or may not have default values. def __init__(self, someImmutableData='', someMutableData=''): self.__someImmutableData = someImmutableData self.__someMutableData = someMutableData def someMutableData( self ): if Ramses.instance().online(): # If the Daemon is available, try to get the data there theData = Ramses.instance().getData() # Only if we've got the data, store and return it if theData is not None: self.__someMutableData = theData return self.__someMutableData # Try to get from the Ramses Tree theData = AnotherClass.getDataFromPath( somePath ) # If we've got the data, store it if theData is not None: self.__someMutableData = theData # Last resort return return self.__someMutableData def someImmutableData( self ): # We start by checking if we already have some data if self.__someImmutableData != '': # Stop here.

Methods Method Arguments Description alternativeFolderPaths \u25b9 list of string A list of alternative absolute paths to the main Ramses folder. Missing files will be looked for in these paths (and copied to the main path if available), and they will be used if the main path is not available. backupFolderPath \u25b9 list of string A copy of the main folder where all files are stored. connect \u25b9 boolean Checks Daemon availability and initiates the connection.

Same as RamSettings.instance() updateStatus RamItem or RamAsset or RamShot : item , RamStatus : status , RamStep : step Runs the scripts in Ramses.instance().statusScripts . Read the section entitled Callbacks below for more details. usersPath \u25b9 string The path to the folder containing users. Callbacks The callbacks are the methods you can add to these lists: Ramses.publishScripts , Ramses.statusScripts , Ramses.importScripts , Ramses.userScripts . When using one of the provided Ramses Add-ons , these callbacks will be called automatically when the user publishes an item, changes the status, or wants to import a file. This makes it very easy to extend these add-ons by just adding your own methods. If you\u2019re developping your own add-on from scratch, it may be useful to add your methods to these lists to call them easily anyway; use Ramses.publish() , Ramses.importItem() , and Ramses.updateStatus() . Ramses will pass a few arguments depending on the context to theses methods, which they\u2019ll have to handle. The table below describes the callbacks. Callback Arguments Description importItem RamItem or RamAsset or RamShot : item , list of string : filePaths , RamStep : step - item is the item from which the user wants to import a file. - filePaths is the list of absolute path to the files the user wants to import. This list can be empty! In this case, it means the add-on must automatically choose the right file from the publish folder of the item and step. - step is the step from which the user wants to import. You can check step.outputPipes() to know which file types have been published, and inputPipes() from the step you\u2019re importing to to know which files to accept. publish RamItem or RamAsset or RamShot : item , string : filePath , RamStep : step - item is the item from which the user wants to publish a file. - filePath is the absolute path to the folder where the user wants to publish. - step is the step from which the user is publishing. You can check step.outputPipes() to know which file types to publish. updateStatus RamItem or RamAsset or RamShot : item , RamStatus : status , RamStep : step - item is the item which is being updated. - status is the new status. - step is the step being updated.

When using one of the provided Ramses Add-ons , these callbacks will be called automatically when the user publishes an item, changes the status, or wants to import a file. This makes it very easy to extend these add-ons by just adding your own methods. If you\u2019re developping your own add-on from scratch, it may be useful to add your methods to these lists to call them easily anyway; use Ramses.publish() , Ramses.importItem() , and Ramses.updateStatus() .

Callback Arguments Description importItem RamItem or RamAsset or RamShot : item , list of string : filePaths , RamStep : step - item is the item from which the user wants to import a file. - filePaths is the list of absolute path to the files the user wants to import.

If the Daemon replies, connection is ready Else, try to start the client and ping again. Check the version of the Daemon which is part of the reply to the ping . Check if the user is logged-in; if not, show an alert and raise the Ramses Client window.

Ramses uses specific file and folder naming conventions . Here are useful regular expressions to manipulate them. Note All names used by Ramses should be compated ignoring the case. Thus all regular expressions should use the i flag. Regular Expressions for files and folder naming. Short Names (IDs) Names Status and versions Extract version from a file name Resource names File names Master media file names Short Names (IDs) /^(?!(?:PUB|WIP|V)?[0-9]+)[a-zA-Z0-9+-]{1,10}$/gi Short names , or ID s are made exclusively of a-z , A-Z, 0-1 and +-` characters, and cannot be more than 10 characters. The negative part of the regular expression, (?!(?:PUB|WIP|V)?[0-9]+) , is used to differenciate regular blocks (name, short name, etc.) from versions. Names /^(?!(?:PUB|WIP|V)?[0-9]+)[ a-zA-Z0-9+-]{1,256}$/gi Names made exclusively of a-z , A-Z , 0-1 , +- and the space characters, and cannot be more than 256 characters. Warning Names should never be used in file names, as it may generate paths which may be very long. The negative part of the regular expression, (?!(?:PUB|WIP|V)?[0-9]+) , is used to differenciate regular blocks (name, short name, etc.) from versions. Status and versions /(PUB|WIP|V)?([0-9]+)/gi The first matching group contains the status (and may be empty), and the second group is the version number. Note The string in the first matching group should be dynamically built using the list of available status ID s ( short names ). By default, it should at least contain the three strings shown in this example: WIP , PUB , and V . Extract version from a file name /(?:(_(v|wip|pub)?([0-9]+)))(?:\\.[a-z0-9.]+)?$/gi This regular expressions matches everything including the last underscore, the version block and the file extension if any.

If you\u2019re developping your own client (or contributing to Ramses Client ), you can easily exchange data with the server using this reference. Queries are made by building a URI containing all information, and the server replies with a JSON object in the body. For almost all queries (i.e. all but ping and login ) you\u2019ll need to be logged in. Initiating a connection to the server usually follows these steps: ping to check if the server is available and check its version. login to authenticate yourself and get a session token. init to get the main data (user list, project list\u2026). For the examples in this documentation, we assume the ramses server is available at http://your.server/ramses/ . For the sake of readability, the JSON replies are formatted with indentation and new lines in this documentation, but the server actually uses one-line replies. Server Replies The JSON objects sent by the server all have the same content: accepted : boolean . True if the server has recognized the query and accepted it. Will be False if the query does not exist. success : boolean . True if the server has successfully processed the query, False in case of any error. message : string . A short feedback about the result, which can be shown to the user by the client. query : string . The query that was made that the server is replying to. content : object . The actual content of the reply, which varies depending on the query. Read this reference for more details.

This naming scheme is based on the short names of the elements, which are defined by the administrator users. We provide a set of regular expressions to help developpers manipulate this naming scheme. File and folder naming scheme Short names (ID) Naming scheme Blocks Examples Master media files and final exports Blocks Examples Short names (ID) In Ramses , all elements (users, assets, shots, projects\u2026) have two names: the actual name used in the user interface and displayed anywhere there is enough room, and a short name which is no longer than 10 characters (but it may be the same as the actual name). Short names are unique (while names may not be unique, although it\u2019s good practice to keep them unique too) and they are used as identifiers. While names can contain a lot of different characters, short names can consist only of alphanumeric characters (without any special character or accent), and the plus + and minus - characters. For the sake of readability, we are going to call these short names : ID s in the rest of this document. Naming scheme This is the complete naming scheme, for all files and folders: projectID_A|S|G(_assetID|shotID)_stepID(_resource name)(_stateVersion)(.extension) Explanations: The name is divided into blocks, separated by the underscore _ character. Optionnal blocks are shown in parenthesis () The vertical bar | characters means \u201cor\u201d and represents a choice in a list of possibilities. A file name must include at least 3 blocks : projectID , Type ( A , S or G ), and stepID and can include up to 6 blocks if adding the assetId or shotID , the resource name, and the version. Blocks projectID is the ID of the project. Between 1 and 10 characters consisting only of a-z , 0-9 and +- characters. No space allowed. A|S|G tells if the file or folder refers to an Asset ( A ), a shot ( S ) or a general item ( G ). assetID is the ID of the asset, if the previous block is A . Between 1 and 10 characters consisting only of a-z , 0-9 and +- characters. No space allowed. shotID is the ID of the shot, if the previous block is S . Between 1 and 10 characters consisting only of a-z , 0-9 and +- characters. No space allowed. stepID is the ID of the production step. Between 1 and 10 characters consisting only of a-z , 0-9 and +- characters. No space allowed. resource name describes the specific resource this file or folder refers to. Between 1 and 20 characters consisting only of a-z , 0-9 and +- characters and may contain spaces. Resource names cannot start with a status ID followed by a number (e.g. v01 or wip2 ) nor a number alone. stateVersion contains the state and version number. The state is either the default v or the ID of the state (e.g. \u201cwip\u201d, \u201cok\u201d, etc.), and the version includes one or more numbers. No other character allowed. extension is the file extension. The extension may include multiple dots, for example: .tar.gz Examples Master media files and final exports Final masters have a specific naming scheme. projectID_codec(-colorspace)_widthxheight(p|i)_fps(_language)_(subtitlesst).ext Blocks projectID is the ID of the project. Between 1 and 10 characters consisting only of a-z , 0-9 and +- characters. No space allowed. codec is the name of the codec. Between 1 and 10 characters consisting only of a-z and 0-9 characters. No space allowed. No dot allowed (e.g. h.264 must be named h264 ). colorspace represents the colorspace used if it\u2019s not the most common one for this codec. Between 1 and 10 characters consisting only of a-z and 0-9 characters. No space allowed. No dot allowed. Examples: YUV420 , sRGB , YUV444 , sRGBA \u2026 widthxheight is the resolution of the file. p|i tells if the video is interlaced or progressive. If omitted, the video is considered progressive. fps is the framerate. A number, which may contain a dot . character, and optionnaly the fps suffix. language is the spoken language. Omitted if there are no dialogs nor any written text. subtitlesst is the language code for the subtitles followed by the st suffix. Omitted if there are no subtitles. ext is the file extension.

This document will also help you find your files should Ramses be unavailable for some reason. Folder Structure: the Ramses Tree Introduction Remote files on Windows Remote files on Unix-like Systems (Linux, Mac OS) The Ramses Folder The Project Folder A working folder Introduction All folders inside the Ramses Tree follow the Ramses Naming Scheme . The folders used by Ramses can be located either locally or on remote computers and servers. The supported protocols (SMB, FTP\u2026) may vary depending on the platform (read below for more information). Ramses includes a system of alternative trees , which means you can use different paths to folders used by Ramses, and that it is compatible with virtually all syncing applications (Dropbox, Syncthing, Synology\u2026), wether they are automatic or manual (like backup tools). If a specific file or folder is not found in the main tree , Ramses will automatically look for it in the alternative trees and try to sync (i.e. copy in the main tree ) them. Tip For best performance, it is advised to work with local files, and use remote locations only as alternative trees ; in conjunction with a syncing tool like Syncthing or the Synology Drive application for example, it is both easy, safe and powerful to keep a shared copy of the projects while working locally. Remote files on Windows Ramses should be able to access files located on remote locations using the Samba ( SMB ) protocol, using standard URL starting with \\\\server-name . Another way to access remote locations, which enables FTP and other protocols support, is to use Windows Network Drives to mount the remote locations. To make it easy to deploy Ramses on several devices, they should all use the same letter for the network drive. Remote files on Unix-like Systems (Linux, Mac OS) The quickest and easiest way to use Ramses on remote folders on Unix-like systems is to automatically mount the remote locations in a specific folder. This can work for a lot of different protocols ( Samba , FTP(s) , SFTP , NFS \u2026) The Ramses Folder The easiest way to use Ramses to manage all your projects is to define a root folder for all Ramses projects, where Ramses will create a subfolder for each project. This Ramses folder is also used to store user specific files, some configuration files, etc. Nevertheless, you can always choose another folder to store a specific project, outside of the Ramses Folder. - Ramses Folder - Config # Configuration files - Projects # All projects - Project01 # First project - Project02 # Second project - ... - Users # User files - User01 # Files for a single user - Config # Configuration files for this user - User02 - Config - ...

PREAMBLE The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \u201cfree\u201d in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \u201ccopyleft\u201d, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \u201cDocument\u201d, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \u201cModified Version\u201d of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \u201cSecondary Section\u201d is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document\u2019s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \u201cInvariant Sections\u201d are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \u201cCover Texts\u201d are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \u201cTransparent\u201d copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \u201cTransparent\u201d is called \u201cOpaque\u201d. Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \u201cTitle Page\u201d means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \u201cTitle Page\u201d means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work\u2019s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The \u201cpublisher\u201d means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, \u201cDedications\u201d, \u201cEndorsements\u201d, or \u201cHistory\u201d.) To \u201cPreserve the Title\u201d of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document\u2019s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document\u2019s license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \u201cHistory\u201d section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d or \u201cDedications\u201d, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version\u2019s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfor example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d; likewise combine any sections Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, and any sections Entitled \u201cDedications\u201d. You must delete all sections Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d. 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \u201caggregate\u201d if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation\u2019s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document\u2019s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, \u201cDedications\u201d, or \u201cHistory\u201d, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ . Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy\u2019s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document. 11. RELICENSING \u201cMassive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\u201d (or \u201cMMC Site\u201d) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \u201cMassive Multiauthor Collaboration\u201d (or \u201cMMC\u201d) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site. \u201cCC-BY-SA\u201d means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization. \u201cIncorporate\u201d means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document. An MMC is \u201celigible for relicensing\u201d if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008. The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page: Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the \u201cwith \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Texts.\u201d line with this: with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation. If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.","title":"Documentation license"},{"location":"licenses/gfdl/#gnu-free-documentation-license","text":"Version 1.3, 3 November 2008 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.","title":"GNU Free Documentation License"},{"location":"licenses/gfdl/#0-preamble","text":"The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \u201cfree\u201d in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.

Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \u201cDocument\u201d, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \u201cModified Version\u201d of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \u201cSecondary Section\u201d is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document\u2019s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \u201cInvariant Sections\u201d are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \u201cCover Texts\u201d are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \u201cTransparent\u201d copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \u201cTransparent\u201d is called \u201cOpaque\u201d. Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \u201cTitle Page\u201d means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \u201cTitle Page\u201d means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work\u2019s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The \u201cpublisher\u201d means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, \u201cDedications\u201d, \u201cEndorsements\u201d, or \u201cHistory\u201d.) To \u201cPreserve the Title\u201d of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.","title":"1.

Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.","title":"3.

In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B.

Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program\u2013to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers\u2019 and authors\u2019 protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users\u2019 and authors\u2019 sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users\u2019 freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. \u201cThis License\u201d refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \u201cCopyright\u201d also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \u201cThe Program\u201d refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d. \u201cLicensees\u201d and \u201crecipients\u201d may be individuals or organizations. To \u201cmodify\u201d a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \u201cmodified version\u201d of the earlier work or a work \u201cbased on\u201d the earlier work. A \u201ccovered work\u201d means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \u201cpropagate\u201d a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \u201cconvey\u201d a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \u201cAppropriate Legal Notices\u201d to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. The \u201csource code\u201d for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \u201cObject code\u201d means any non-source form of a work. A \u201cStandard Interface\u201d means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The \u201cSystem Libraries\u201d of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \u201cMajor Component\u201d, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \u201cCorresponding Source\u201d for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work\u2019s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users\u2019 Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work\u2019s users, your or third parties\u2019 legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program\u2019s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \u201ckeep intact all notices\u201d. c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \u201caggregate\u201d if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation\u2019s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A \u201cUser Product\u201d is either (1) a \u201cconsumer product\u201d, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \u201cnormally used\u201d refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. \u201cInstallation Information\u201d for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms. \u201cAdditional permissions\u201d are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \u201cfurther restrictions\u201d within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An \u201centity transaction\u201d is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party\u2019s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents. A \u201ccontributor\u201d is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor\u2019s \u201ccontributor version\u201d. A contributor\u2019s \u201cessential patent claims\u201d are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \u201ccontrol\u201d includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor\u2019s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a \u201cpatent license\u201d is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \u201cgrant\u201d such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \u201cKnowingly relying\u201d means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient\u2019s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others\u2019 Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy\u2019s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \u201cAS IS\u201d WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \u201ccopyright\u201d line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: <program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. The hypothetical commands `show w\u2019 and `show c\u2019 should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program\u2019s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \u201cabout box\u201d. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \u201ccopyright disclaimer\u201d for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ . The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html .","title":"GNU GPLv3"},{"location":"licenses/gnu-gpl/#gnu-general-public-license","text":"Version 3, 29 June 2007 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.","title":"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE"},{"location":"licenses/gnu-gpl/#preamble","text":"The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program\u2013to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers\u2019 and authors\u2019 protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users\u2019 and authors\u2019 sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users\u2019 freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.","title":"Preamble"},{"location":"licenses/gnu-gpl/#terms-and-conditions","text":"","title":"TERMS AND CONDITIONS"},{"location":"licenses/gnu-gpl/#0-definitions","text":"\u201cThis License\u201d refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \u201cCopyright\u201d also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \u201cThe Program\u201d refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.

But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.
