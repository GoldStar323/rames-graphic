!!! hint
    *Ramses* comes with a set of step templates, but they can be completely adjusted to any production needs; for example, if you consider *Character Desgin* to be a pre-production step instead of an asset production step, it's up to you to customize the templates.

    **The list of template steps is available and can be managed in the [*Ramses Client Application*](../components/client/index.md), under [the administration panel](../components/client/admin.md) (for administrator users)**.
