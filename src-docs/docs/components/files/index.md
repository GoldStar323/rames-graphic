# The Ramses Tree

*Ramses* is able to manage all the files associated with projects. To handle these, it uses a specific [naming scheme](naming.md) which has been carefully crafted to be powerful (it contains all information *Ramses* needs to efficiently handle the files and folders), and easy to respect (it is simple to manually rename files and folders).

Although one of the goal of *Ramses* is to enable you to work without ever having to use your system's file explorer but only *Ramses* tools, it is strongly advised to read this documentation about the naming conventions and folder structure to make sure all your files can be handled by *Ramses*.  
Every file and folder you create manually can be detected and managed by *Ramses* if it's correcly named and located.

- Read the [*Ramses naming conventions*](naming.md).
- Check out the [*Ramses Tree*](tree.md), the folder structure.
