# Add-ons

Ramses comes with some add-ons to be used in your creative applications (*Blender*, *Maya*, *After Effects*...)

They will be developed one after each other, and you're welcome to contribute with your own!

Here are some guidelines and descriptions about how these add-ons should work. We're trying to apply the same guidelines to all host applications for a unified experience. These add-ons should use the provided [*Scripting API*](../dev/add-ons-reference/index.md) available at first in *Python* and *Adobe ExtendsScript*.
