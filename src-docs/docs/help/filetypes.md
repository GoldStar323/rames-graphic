# ![](../img/icons/files_sd.svg){: style="width:32px;"} File types

In order to manage the assets and the files they use, *Ramses* keeps track of the *File Types* used in the production.

Specific file types can be marked as *preview types*, which means they're light and standard and can be used to display or preview an asset, but can store data in a lossy manner.

The *Ramses client* can also display and preview file types marked as *preview types*.

## Attributes

The file types are defined by their:

- ***Name / Short description***
- ***Default extension***

The file types also have these additional attributes:

- ***Extension list***: the list of alternative file extensions (i.e. *.jpeg* for *jpg* files).
