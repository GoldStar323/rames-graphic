# ![](../img/icons/assetgroups_sl.svg){: style="width:32px;"} Asset Groups

*Asset Groups* store the assets of a project. They can be for example : *Characters*, *Sets*, *Props*...

Each Asset Group stores a list of [Assets](assets.md), and each [Asset](assets.md) belong to one and only one Asset Group.

## Attributes

As any other object in *Ramses*, the steps are defined by their:

- ***Name***
- ***Short Name***

The asset groups also have these additional attributes:

- ***Assets***: The list of assets stored by this step.
- ***Folder***: Each asset group also has its own folder inside the project file structure, to keep all common assets for the given group. See the [*Ramses Tree*](../files/tree.md) for more information.
