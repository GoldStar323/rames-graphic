# ![](../img/icons/cinema-movie-settings_sl.svg){: style="width:32px;"} Projects

*Projects* represent the final artwork: a feature film or one of its sequence, an episode in a TV series, a short movie, a music video...

It is made of *Shots* which are in turned made of *Assets*.

*Assets* and *Shots* are produced through different *Steps* which are interdependent.

*Shots* are grouped in *Sequences*, and a project contains at least one sequence.

*Assets* are grouped in *Asset Groups* (e.g. characters, sets, props...).

!!! note
    It is not mandatory to use sequences, and for short projects (less than a hundred shots), it is usually easier to just have a single sequence.
