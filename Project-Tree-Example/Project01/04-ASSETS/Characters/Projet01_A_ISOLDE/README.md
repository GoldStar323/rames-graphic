# Root folder for the *Isolde* asset

Inside the root folder are subfolders for each step, whose names follow this convention:
    projectShortName_ramType_objectShortName_stepShortName

Steps' names and shortNames are defined by the user and cannot be changed afterwards, due to the sheer amount of folders, files, and internal data using these names.
