# The folder containing the publish files of the asset or shot.

The folder only holds the latest publish files, without versionning.
These publish files get overwritten once a new publish is made.
The publish versions are available in the "ramses_versions" folder.

This folder contains both the final file and its associated exports, such as an alembic export for modelling or animation.
It contains both the publish of the main working file and those of the secondary (commented) working files.
